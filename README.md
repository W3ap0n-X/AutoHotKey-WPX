# WPXCode-Autohotkey README

My own take on a syntax highlighting and language extension for Autohotkey and vscode. 

I want my autohotkey scripts to light up light a php file in my editor simply because it makes me happy. Hopefully add some useful and helpful features along the way.

## Features

-Obsessive compulsive syntax highlighting


** Maybe Someday **
-snippets for built in functions
-context/command sensitive highlighting
-hover, completions, references, all the fun stuff. 

## Known Issues

- Scopes are  all over the place. not too ugly but many obscure ones are used to calibrate the highlighting. Not currently ready for regular use.
